        <p>Goals</p>

        <p>By the end of the day, I want to attend the translating wireframes to code breakout, finish this drill, and hopefully
            submit the first multi-page websites drill. I have all day to work besides the break-out at 2:30 so I think this
            is all achievable.</p>

        <p>Reflection</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I did not meet all my goals for the day. I was able to attend the multi-page websites breakout as well
            as finish this drill by the end of the day. Both of these things were on my goal list. However, I was unable
            to complete the first drill in multi-page websites because I am still having a hard time understanding the CSS.
            In order to complete the drill I need to understand the CSS first. The breakout I attended helped me understand
            it a little better but I still did not complete the drill. There is a continued multi-page website/wireframe
            breakout on this concept tomorrow so hopefully I can be prepared to complete the drill by tomorrow. I am also
            going to do some more CSS/Flexbox practice exercises tonight and tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>Post 2</h2>
        <p>Goals</p>

        <p> By the end of the day I would like to finish Javascript drill two, finish this drill, and start on my final websites
            drill. I think this will be achievable because I am already on the final test of drill two for Javascript, and
            the rest is pretty easy.</p>

        <p>Reflection</p>

        <p>All my goals were met for the day. I finished Javascript and I was able to get a very good start on my last website
            drill. These things were both on my goals list and I am happy to say I am starting to understand flexbox a lot
            better now and I am working through my last website a lot faster than my first. I am also starting to understand
            Javascript a little better although I am still having a hard time with it. I was also able to finish writing
            this by the end of the day, therefore I will be able to turn in this drill. A thing that did not go well today
            was the fact that I am still having a hard time with Javascript even though I have had a lot of practice with
            it. I was hoping to finish the last test of Javascript drill two on my own but I ended up having to get help
            from a friend. Something I could do differently next time I write some Javascript is to try harder to figure
            it out on my own and not ask for help as fast as last time. I could also try doing some more practice exercises
            for Javascript before I move on to the final drill.</p>
