                <p>My name is Josh and I am 20 years old. I am a recent Arapahoe High School graduate and a student in Galvanize
                    G90, as well as a Colorado native. My hobbies include exotic cars, distance running, and video games.
                    Here is a photo of me standing next to a 3 million dollar Koenigsegg previously owned by Floyd Mayweather,
                    as well as some other supercars.</p>
