        <p>Recently I learned how to use flexbox. In order to learn flexbox, first I must set the stage. The first step to setting
            the stage is by clearing the stage. I did that by removing all tabs in my browser that serve as distractions.
            In this case it was youtube and facebook. After that I needed to clarify the what and the why. The what is flexbox,
            and the why is because learning flexbox will allow me to write CSS more efficently. I will be able to apply flexbox
            whenever I build a website or application. I also need to remember to prioritize process over product. This means
            that instead of trying to get the CSS drills done as fast as I can, I need to learn how flexbox works and what
            makes the code do what. I may be able to write specific flexbox code for one website, but I can't always use
            the same code for the next website I make. Also, if certain flexbox code works for what I am trying to do, but
            I don't know why, I need to figure out why it is doing that instead of just moving on. This happened to me a
            couple times where I got something to work but I didn't know exactly why it changed.</p>

        <p>When I learn flexbox, I also need to "play". I can do this by wrestling with the information I am learning. Instead
            of applying flexbox code in one certain way, I can play around with it and change things up so I can see it from
            different angles and learn its functionality better. Sometimes, there are multiple ways to do something in CSS.
            For example, margin and padding are different from each other but they serve relatively the same purpose. I also
            need to take risks. For example, a couple times I tried some code I did not think would work while doing the
            drills. However, some of it ended up working after all and I learned from it. I also need to have fun with what
            I'm doing. This means that whenever I am getting frustrated with CSS/flexbox, I can take a short break, then
            come back and fix it. I can also learn by building something on my own and having fun with it, instead of always
            applying what I'm learning to the drills.</p>

        <p>Reflection</p>


        <p>Finally, after I'm finished writing my code, I can reflect on what I learned. To do this, I self assess by asking
            myself what my goal was and whether I completed it. I can also ask myself how well I set the stage and how well
            did I "play". I can also ask myself what I can do better next time. After I started getting the hang of flexbox,
            I decided I could set the stage better next time by not looking at my phone as often. Often times when I get
            stuck on something I automatically check my phone. This is a distraction and it affects my ability to "play".
            Next time, I want to work on pushing through the problem when I am stuck instead of automatically turning to
            my phone for a while.</p>

        <p>Although I have gotten a lot better at flexbox, I hope to continue improving enough so that I don't have to apply
            trial and error very often. This happened less and less as I continued to do the website drills.</p>

        <h2>Post 2</h2>
        <p>I have recently been learning the basics of Javascript. In order to learn Javascript most efficiently, I need to
            first set the stage for my learning. I can start by clearing the stage. I did this by removing all distractions,
            including my instagram and twitter tabs. Then, I need to clarify the what and the why. The what is Javascript,
            and the why is because Javascript is the most important language for web development, therefore it is essential
            that I master it in order to get a job. The next step in setting the stage is prioritizing process over product.
            This means that I need to understand how the Javascript in my drills truly works. I made the mistake of having
            someone show me how to do the first Javascript drill, and then I immediately turned in the drill, even though
            I didn't really understand how it worked. I prioritized product over process, and that is something I need to
            make sure I don't do in all the other Javascript drills. This also affected the "play" phase. Instead of turning
            in a drill when I know the code works, I need to understand why the code works and know exactly what's happening
            in each line of code.

            <p>Then comes the "play". I can "play" with Javascript by wrestling with the information. For example, there are
                multiple ways I can make something happen in Javascript. Instead of just trying just one way to make something
                happen, I can change up the code and see if I can do it a different way. The other way might even end up
                being more efficient code than what I originally thought of. I should also take risks. There aren't really
                any huge risks I can take with coding but one risk I could take is trying all possible ways of solving a
                Javascript problem even if I'm pretty sure it won't work. If the code I try fails or gets pushed back then
                I can still learn from it. The last thing is to have fun. I have fun with Javascript when I solve problems
                on my own and I can apply it to building something. If a Javascript problem starts to frustrate me then I
                should take a break and come back to it.</p>
            <p>Reflection</p>
            <p>To reflect on what I learned, I can first self assess by asking myself if I completed my objective, and if not,
                how far I am from completing it. My objective was to learn the basics of Javascript. I am not yet finished
                with that objective because I still feel like I don't fully understand all of it yet. I still have one more
                Javascript drill to finish, so hopefully I will understand it more when I'm done. Next time, I think I can
                improve by asking more questions when I do a drill. I am often still confused even after I do a drill so
                I need to ask more questions about what the syntax is doing.</p>
            <p>I hope to continue getting better at Javascript in the future so that when I get to bucket two, I can write most
                of the Javascript on my own.</p>

            <h2>Post 3</h2>
            <p>Recently I learned how to write semantic HTML. When I learned this, I set the stage by clearing the stage, clarifying
                the what and the why, and prioritizing process over product. I first cleared the stage by removing all distractions
                fom my computer. I got rid of the Reddit tab in my browser and put my computer on do not disturb. Then I
                clarified the what and the why. The what is semantic HTML, and the why is so I can learn to write proper
                HTML code. I prioritized process over product by taking my time with the code and making sure I understood
                it instead of just immediately turning in work. This led to me wrestling with the information in the "play"
                stage.
            </p>

            <p>For the "play" stage, I wrestled with the information by researching all the semantic HTML elements and learning
                how to apply them. I also took risks because I wasn't completely sure all my HTML from the website drills
                was semantic or even proper code, but I turned it in. If I get the drill kicked back then I can still learn
                from it. Finally, I had fun with the HTML because it was something I had not previously learned, and I had
                fun learning it and applying it to my drills.</p>

            <p>Reflection</p>

            <p>I reflected on my work by first self assessing. I asked myself what my objective was and if I accomplished it.
                My objective was to start writing semantic HTML on my own, which I did. I also asked myself how well I set
                the stage. I think I did a good job setting the stage because I removed all distractions, clarified the what
                and why before coding, and I prioritized process over product. This helped me out when I got to the "play"
                stage. I also asked myself new questions such as why I should try to avoid using div tags, then I did research
                on that question.</p>
            <p>I hope to continue getting better at writing semantic HTML to the point where I rarely make mistakes in future
                drills. I also want to learn more about all the semantic HTML elements and eventually use all of them because
                I have not practiced using all of them in my code.</p>
