        <p>Meetup Information</p>

        <p>Tech Friendraiser on May 2 2018.</p>

        <p>People I Met</p>

        <p>Pam Narowski-VP of Strategic Develoment at Boulder Bits. David Kircos-Financial Engineer at Techstars. Jared Polis
            - congressman and Techstars co-founder who is also running for governor.</p>

        <p>What I Learned</p>

        <p>I learned a lot about Jared Polis and his background as well as what he plans to do if he wins the position for governor.
            Unfortunately I did not learn a lot about coding although Jared Polis did talk a lot about the tech community
            and how he plans to support it. He has started many tech companies and has made a big influence in the Colorado
            tech community.</p>

        <p>Questions I Have</p>

        <p>What is the best way to follow up with someone I met at a meetup who could potentially get me a job?</p>

        <p>Meetup Information</p>
        <p>I went to the NewTech meetup on Thursday, May 17th.</p>
        <p>People I Met</p>
        <p>Jonathon Yarbor, CEO of Nodecraft, and Dave Noreen, CEO of Save Away 401k.</p>
        <p>What I Learned</p>
        <p>I learned about some new tech startups in Denver and across the country. Five or six CEO's spoke about their company's,
            some of which were company's like Nodecraft, Save Away 401k, and BizEatz. Nodecraft is a company that allows
            PC gamers to easily rent game servers from the company rather than go through the trouble of making one themselves.
            Save Away 401k is a retirement savings company, and BizEatz is a company that delivers food to business travelers
            on the go. I also learned that a company called Xero is moving from San Francisco to Platte Street and is looking
            to hire multiple developers.</p>
        <p>Questions I Have</p>
        <p>What kind of company is Xero and will they still be hiring in October? If so, what kind of developers?</p>

        <p>Meetup Information</p>
        <p>Negotiation Skills, 5/22</p>
        <p>People I Met</p>
        <p>Keifer - In marketing, looking for a new job. Jill Bartholomew - Division Director at The Creative Group</p>
        <p>What I Learned</p>
        <p>I learned the best ways to negotiate starting salary and/or a raise. I also learned a lot about entrepreneurship
            and the structure of a company. To negotiate salary you have to prepare for the interview and do research about
            the market beforehand. Also, I learned you should almost never accept their initial offer.
        </p>
        <p>Questions I Have</p>
        <p>What is a good salary a junior web developer should be able to negotiate up to?</p>
